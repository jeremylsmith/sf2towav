# sf2towav

If you want to extract WAV files that make up a Soundfont (2) file, this will do it.

To use:

Run setup_sf2towav.exe and install the software.

Then when you want to extract from a target Soundfont (.SF2) file, right-click the target SF2 in its folder, and SendTo->sf2towav.exe

It will then put the extracted WAVs in the folder of the target SF2.

Note: The file SFSpec200b.rtf is the Soundfont 2.0 Technical Specification document, version 2.00b, May 2, 1997. This is hard to find online, so here it is!
